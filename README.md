# 🏢 Enterprise-Level Network Security Architecture using SDN in Cisco Packet Tracer

## 🚀 Overview
In modern enterprise networks, **security, scalability, and automation** are crucial. This project explores how **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** can **enhance network security and management efficiency** compared to traditional **CLI-based configurations**.

Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, we designed a **secure, scalable, and automated network architecture** by integrating **SDN controllers**, **routers**, **switches**, and **enterprise security policies**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Network Simulation)
- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol**
- **Virtual LANs (VLANs) & Access Control**
- **Secure Shell (SSH) for Device Management**
- **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting Tools**

## 📊 Key Features
🔹 **Traditional vs. SDN-based Network Management:**  
Comparison between **manual CLI configurations** and **automated SDN policies**.  

🔹 **Enterprise-Level Security:**  
Implemented **Access Control Lists (ACLs), VLAN segmentation, and SSH authentication** for secure communication.  

🔹 **Centralized Network Control with SDN:**  
Deployed **SDN controllers** to manage devices **centrally** for **faster configuration and policy enforcement**.  

🔹 **Path Tracing & Real-Time Monitoring:**  
Enabled **traffic flow visualization** and **automated network diagnostics** for quick issue detection.  

## 🔬 Research Objectives
✅ **Evaluate CLI-based vs. SDN-based network management efficiency**  
✅ **Improve security with centralized access control & automation**  
✅ **Enhance scalability and flexibility in enterprise networks**  

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Load the `.pkt` project file.
3. Access **CLI for manual configurations** or use the **SDN Controller** for automated settings.
4. Use **debugging & monitoring tools** to analyze performance.
